  # Home

  Here I am using **markdown**. And there is plently of things you can do.

  > Like this quote. Of course if you want to look good you should change the style

  You can also talk abou a `file` and add some code:

  ```python
  @APP.route("/")
  @APP.route("/home.html")
  def home():
      """ home page """
      return render_template("home.html", **_read_yaml("home"))
  ```

  And images
  <div class="w3-center">
    <img src="/static/expensorpy.jpg" alt="expensorpy" class="w3-image w3-padding-16"/>
  </div>
